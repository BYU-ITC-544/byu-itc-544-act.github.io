The company provides both walk-in gaming services and online tournament hosting for local and regional gamers. A new branch is opening in Austin, Texas, requiring reliable IT services to support gaming PCs, online tournaments, and customer Wi-Fi access.

## Selected Service: Internet Service Provider (ISP)

The ISP provides internet connectivity for the Austin branch, supporting all gaming PCs, staff workstations, Wi-Fi for customers, online tournament servers, and point-of-sale systems.
