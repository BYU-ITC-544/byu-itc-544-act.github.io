By completing this assignment, you will:
- Understand the foundational principles of a chosen project management methodology.
- Reflect on how the methodology influences planning, execution, and collaboration in technical teams.
- Evaluate the applicability of the methodology to your own academic or professional context.
- Develop critical thinking about the alignment between project methodologies and organizational goals.
