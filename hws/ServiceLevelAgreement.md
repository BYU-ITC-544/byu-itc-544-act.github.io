# Service Level Agreement

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expectations, responsibilities, and performance standards for the delivery of a specific service. The purpose of an SLA is to ensure that both parties clearly understand the scope of services, the quality and reliability requirements, and the methods for monitoring and resolving issues. In the context of Frostbyte Gaming Cafés, this SLA establishes the terms for the provision of internet services by the ISP, setting performance benchmarks, response times, and accountability measures to support uninterrupted gaming operations, customer access, and business-critical systems. By defining these expectations, the SLA helps maintain high service quality, reduces operational risk, and ensures that any service issues are addressed promptly and effectively.
