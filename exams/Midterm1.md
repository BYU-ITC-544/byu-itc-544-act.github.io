# Midterm Exam: Design and Operations of a Data Center

Data centers serve as the backbone of modern IT infrastructure, supporting cloud computing, enterprise applications, storage solutions, and critical business operations. This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of the essential factors influencing data center design and ongoing operations from a system administrator's perspective. You are expected to analyze, compare, and propose best practices based on current industry standards and technological advancements.

By the end of this assignment, students will be able to:

1. Identify and describe critical design considerations for data centers.
1. Analyze operational factors that affect performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Design Considerations
Discuss at least five key factors that influence the physical and logical design of a data center.

Examples include: 
- Location
- Scalability
- Cooling Systems
- Power Supply
- Physical Security
- Network Topology.

## Operational Considerations
Explain five factors that affect day-to-day operations of a data center.

Include considerations such as: 
- Disaster Recovery
- Uptime
- Monitoring Tools
- Patch Management
- Staffing
- compliance

## Technological Trends
Discuss at least two emerging trends (e.g., edge computing, AI-driven infrastructure, green data centers, containerization) and how they affect system administration practices.

| **Design Considerations (25 pts)**        | Clearly identifies and thoroughly explains at least **5 key design factors** with detailed analysis, industry relevance, and examples.                | Identifies and explains 5 design factors with adequate detail and clarity.                       | Identifies fewer than 5 factors OR provides limited explanation with minimal detail.           | Identifies fewer than 3 factors OR provides vague/inaccurate discussion. |
| **Operational Considerations (25 pts)**   | Provides an in-depth explanation of **5 operational factors**, linking them to performance, reliability, and scalability; includes specific examples. | Explains 5 operational factors with reasonable clarity and some supporting detail.               | Explains fewer than 5 factors OR gives limited surface-level discussion.                       | Missing or inaccurate explanations of operational factors.               |
| **Technological Trends (20 pts)**         | Discusses at least **2 emerging trends** with strong insight on implications for system administration; uses industry examples or references.         | Discusses 2 trends with adequate explanation of relevance to system administration.              | Discusses only 1 trend OR provides shallow analysis with limited connection to administration. | No meaningful discussion of trends OR incorrect/misunderstood concepts.  |
| **Analysis & Critical Thinking (15 pts)** | Demonstrates strong critical thinking by comparing, contrasting, and evaluating best practices; provides thoughtful recommendations.                  | Demonstrates some critical thinking and evaluation but may lack depth or strong recommendations. | Limited critical analysis; mostly descriptive without evaluation.                              | Minimal or no analysis; lacks evidence of understanding.                 |
| **Organization & Clarity (10 pts)**       | Report is **well-structured**, logically organized, and clearly written; headings used effectively; minimal grammar or spelling errors.               | Report is generally clear and organized; some minor grammar or flow issues.                      | Report has weak organization or frequent grammar issues that affect clarity.                   | Report is poorly organized, unclear, and difficult to follow.            |
| **Citations & Professionalism (5 pts)**   | Uses **credible sources** with proper citations (APA/MLA/other specified style); professional formatting and tone.                                    | Some sources used with mostly correct citations; professional tone maintained.                   | Few or weak sources; inconsistent or incorrect citation format.                                | No sources cited; unprofessional or incomplete formatting.               |
