# Midterm Exam: Design and Operations of a Data Center

Data centers serve as the backbone of modern IT infrastructure, supporting cloud computing, enterprise applications, storage solutions, and critical business operations. This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of the essential factors influencing data center design and ongoing operations from a system administrator's perspective. You are expected to analyze, compare, and propose best practices based on current industry standards and technological advancements.

By the end of this assignment, students will be able to:

1. Identify and describe critical design considerations for data centers.
1. Analyze operational factors that affect performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Design Considerations
Discuss at least five key factors that influence the physical and logical design of a data center.

Examples include: 
- Location
- Scalability
- Cooling Systems
- Power Supply
- Physical Security
- Network Topology.

## Operational Considerations
Explain five factors that affect day-to-day operations of a data center.

Include considerations such as: 
- Disaster Recovery
- Uptime
- Monitoring Tools
- Patch Management
- Staffing
- compliance

## Technological Trends
Discuss at least two emerging trends (e.g., edge computing, AI-driven infrastructure, green data centers, containerization) and how they affect system administration practices.
